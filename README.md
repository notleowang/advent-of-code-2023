## Getting Started
Follow these instructions if you wish to run my solutions on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
1. Check if you have `python` installed.
```bash
python --version
```
2. If you do not have `python` installed, you can get the latest release [here](https://www.python.org/).

### Installation
1. Clone the repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/notleowang/advent-of-code-2023.git
```
2. Set current directory to the solution you want for the given day.
```
cd day_<day-number>
```
3. Run `main.py`.
```bash
python main.py
```
4. (Optional) Run `main.py` with parameters. This will give you the solution to a part only.
```bash
python main.py 1    // prints solution to part 1
python main.py 2    // prints solution to part 2
```
